auth-server
===========
This is the auth server that was worked on by Light, Treeku, and Darrk. It was done quickly, so it's open to improvements.
I've cleaned it up quickly and put in proper folders, and added missing files from Treeku's attachment on the forums.

Treeku - If you're starting up the Auth Server ever and you get a "cannot bind error" you may have to keep rebooting it for up to an hour for it to work. The Auth Server was rushed and is full of minor exceptions. 

Please commit to master. When anything is moved to the 'Release' branch, it is on the live server and in use.
